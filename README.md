## External services used
- For drawing most of the menu [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) did a great job, on serving as a documentation on [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters).
- Headers within the application were created using the website [patorjk.com](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/). This website allows to create big text in many different styles and fonts.
